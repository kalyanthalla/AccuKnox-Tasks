# Django Signals and Python Custom Classes Demonstration

This project demonstrates two key aspects:
1. Django Signals behavior (synchronous execution, thread behavior, and transaction handling)
2. Python custom iterable class (Rectangle class with iteration support)

## Part 1: Django Signals Demonstration

### Question 1: Synchronous Execution

**Are Django signals executed synchronously by default?**

Yes, Django signals execute synchronously by default.

**Proof:**
#python
from django.db.models.signals import pre_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import time

@receiver(pre_save)
def blocking_handler(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler START - about to sleep for 2 seconds")
    time.sleep(2)  # Blocking call
    print("Signal handler END")

# When you call model.save(), execution will block for 2 seconds
# proving synchronous execution

Question 2: Thread Behavior
Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?

Yes, signals run in the same thread as the caller.

Proof:

import threading
from django.dispatch import Signal

test_signal = Signal()

@receiver(test_signal)
def thread_handler(sender, **kwargs):
    print(f"Handler thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Trigger signal
print(f"Caller thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
test_signal.send(sender=None)
# Output shows both print same thread name

Question 3: Transaction Handling
Do Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller?

Yes, signals participate in the same transaction when called within an atomic block.

Proof:

from django.db import transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

@receiver(post_save)
def transaction_handler(sender, **kwargs):
    print(f"In transaction: {transaction.get_autocommit()}")

# Outside transaction
some_model.save()  # Output: In transaction: True

# Inside transaction
with transaction.atomic():
    some_model.save()  # Output: In transaction: False


Part 2: Python Custom Iterable Class
Rectangle Class Implementation
A Rectangle class that supports iteration over its dimensions.

Features:

Initialize with length and width

Iteration yields length then width as dictionaries

Clean string representation

Code:
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length: int, width: int):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
    def __iter__(self):
        self._iter_index = 0
        return self
    def __next__(self):
        if self._iter_index == 0:
            self._iter_index += 1
            return {'length': self.length}
        elif self._iter_index == 1:
            self._iter_index += 1
            return {'width': self.width}
        raise StopIteration
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Rectangle(length={self.length}, width={self.width})


Usage Example:

rect = Rectangle(5, 10)
print(rect)  # Output: Rectangle(length=5, width=10)

for dimension in rect:
    print(dimension)
# Output:
# {'length': 5}
# {'width': 10}


Setup and Running
Django Signals Project
Create and activate virtual environment

Install dependencies: pip install django

Run migrations: python manage.py migrate

Start server: python manage.py runserver

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/test-signals/

Rectangle Class
Simply import the Rectangle class from rectangle.py and use as shown above.

Key Findings
Django Signals:

Execute synchronously by default

Run in the same thread as the caller

Participate in the caller's transaction context

Rectangle Class:

Clean implementation of Python iteration protocol

Provides dictionary output for each dimension

Easy to extend with additional functionality
